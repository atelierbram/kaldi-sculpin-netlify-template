    Coffee is a small tree or shrub that grows in the forest understory in its
    wild form, and traditionally was grown commercially under other trees that
    provided shade. The forest-like structure of shade coffee farms provides
    habitat for a great number of migratory and resident species.

    Single-origin coffee is coffee grown within a single known geographic
    origin. Sometimes, this is a single farm or a specific collection of beans
    from a single country. The name of the coffee is then usually the place it
    was grown to whatever degree available.

    Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on an
    understanding of ecosystem services, the study of relationships between
    organisms and their environment. What grows where and how it is grown are a
    matter of choice and careful consideration for nature and communities.

    Direct trade is a form of sourcing practiced by some coffee roasters.
    Advocates of direct trade practices promote direct communication and price
    negotiation between buyer and farmer, along with systems that encourage and
    incentivize quality

    text4: We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.  That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
